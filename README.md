### Introduction

Brain tumors are recognized as one of the most formidable diseases affecting both children and adults. They represent 85 to 90 percent of all primary tumors in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Every year, about 11,700 individuals are diagnosed with a brain tumor. When it comes to the 5-year survival rate, men with a malignant brain or CNS tumor have a survival rate of approximately 34 percent, while women have a slightly higher rate of 36 percent. Brain tumors can be categorized into various types such as Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, and so on. To enhance patients' life expectancy, the emphasis should be on thorough treatment planning and precise diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most effective method for detecting brain tumors. The procedure produces a substantial amount of image data, which is subsequently scrutinized by radiologists. Manual examination, however, can be susceptible to errors given the intricate nature of brain tumors and their characteristics.

In many developing countries, the scarcity of skilled physicians and a lack of awareness about tumors can lead to challenges and delays in generating reports from MRI scans. Implementing an automated system on the Cloud could address this issue. In an effort to automate the detection and classification of brain tumors, I'm employing Deep Learning Algorithms using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transfer Learning (TL). For training, I'm using a dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri.
